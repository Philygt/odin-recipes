<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    There have been many arguments and lost friendships regarding the order in which milk is added to cereal. 
    Today we will end the debate.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Cereal of choice. I prefer Cheerios at this old age. </li>
    <li>Oatmilk (stop drinking milk, Anthony. You don't even put anything in it.)</li>
</ul>

<ol>Steps
    <li>Place the bowl on an even surface.</li>
    <li>Pour your Cereal of choice gently into the bowl.</li>
    <li>Resist the urge to perform these steps out of order. </li>
    <li>Pour the Oatmilk into the bowl.</li>
    <li>Insert spoon, and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
